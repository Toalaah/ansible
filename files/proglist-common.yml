# This file defines common packages which should be installed regardless of OS.
#
# As some of these programs are GUI applications, they must be installed as
# Homebrew casks when on macOS. Hence, we must differentiate these packages via
# a separate 'casks' array to tell Ansible to install the respective packages
# as casks rather than normal programs.
#
# OSs which don't care about this differentiation (ex. Arch Linux) simply
# concatenate the two arrays together when installing packages.
